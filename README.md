Hierarchical Agglomerative CLustering in Python.

This implementation implements a range of distance metrics and clustering methods, like single-linkage clustering, group-average clustering and Ward or minimum variance clustering. 

Besides a regular implementation of the cluster algorithm, this script provides functionality to perform Variability-based Neighbor Clustering (e.g. Gries & Hilpert 2006). This is a method of clustering in which the order of allowed clusters is predetermined.

The script is well documented, so it should not be hard to understand. 

Numpy is required to run the script. Scipy and Matplotlib are optional if you want to draw dendrograms.
