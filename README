Hierarchical Agglomerative CLustering in Python.

This implementation implements a range of distance metrics, and clustering methods, like single-linkage clustering, group-average clustering and Ward or minimum variance clustering. 

Besides a regular implementation of the cluster algorithm, this script provides functionality to perform Variability-based Neighbor Clustering (e.g. Gries & Hilpert 2006). This is a method of clustering in which the order of allowed clusters is predetermined.

The script is well-documented, so it should not be to hard to understand. 

You will need the following external modules to get the most out of the script:
  1. Numpy
  2. Scipy
  3. Matplotlib
